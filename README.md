# zig-rtweekend
Following along with "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" (https://raytracing.github.io) in Zig. Mostly an exericise in learning Zig.

A key difference is that while the original code C++ code avoided
templates completely, I am trying to make all functions generic.
The code might not be particularly idiomatic due to the more-or-less
direct translation from C++, but I have tried to look up and come up
with programming patterns better suited for Zig.

Completed chapter 7 of book 1. See `images/`.

TODO: update readme with progress update, add images
